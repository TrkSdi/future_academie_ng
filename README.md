# FutureAcademie

This Angular front end is part of the "Fil Rouge" project for our software development training program.

## The Stack

The frontend will use Angular 17 and Bootstrap. Our [back end Rest API](https://github.com/TrkSdi/futur_academie) uses Django 5 and Postgres. Both will be deployed in a Docker container.
